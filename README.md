Project Name: Webcam Object Detection with YOLOv5

Project Description: This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model on webcam input. It captures images from the webcam, processes them using YOLOv5, and displays the detected objects.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, YOLOv5

Key Features:
- Real-time object detection: Detects objects in real-time from webcam input.
- YOLOv5 integration: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for accurate and efficient object detection.
- Easy setup: Runs seamlessly in Google Colab environment with minimal setup required.

Installation Instructions:
1. Open the code in a Google Colab environment.
2. Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed, including OpenCV, PyTorch, and YOLOv5.
3. Execute the provided code to start capturing webcam input and perform object detection.

Get started with real-time object detection using your webcam with YOLOv5!
